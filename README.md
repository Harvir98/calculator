# calculator

Hi and welcome to my first major project involving JavaScript. It involved building a calculator. To create the calculator I used HTML, SCSS and Javascript.

<!-- Variables -->

// Assigned all the major buttons on the calculator a variable by fetching them from the HTML using (DOM manipulation?)

// Created (global) variables with no values as they will be used to store a operator or number.

<!-- Numbers -->

// As numbers is not a array we use forEach to iterate over each number and create a function for them.

// Within the forEach method, I created an if statement, so if the input.innerHTML (display screen) displayed one of the four symbols created then it would display an empty screen by using empty string. 


<!-- Symbols -->

// Similar to the numbers variable I used a forEach method to iterate through each symbol. I assigned the firstNumber variable to the first input in the display screen.
